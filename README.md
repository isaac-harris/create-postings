# create-postings
Run the create_posting.py file and type in the number of randomly generated postings you want.
You do not need the posted_listings.txt file as one will be generated for you
You do need the tags, countries, industries and names .txt files and can add new tags/names etc by adding a new line
You can find the order of the elements in each posting by looking at the code in create_posting.py
